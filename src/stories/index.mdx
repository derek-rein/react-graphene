React-Graphene is a powerful scientific charting component for React, inspired by PyQtGraph. It provides interactive, high-performance graphs for scientific and financial data visualization.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation** - Pan and zoom with mouse/touch controls
- **Time Series Data** - Plot time-based data with appropriate axes
- **Customizable Grids** - Control grid line appearance including color and thickness
- **High Performance** - Built with HTML Canvas for optimal rendering
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to container size
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type definitions for improved development experience

## Basic Usage

To use React-Graphene in your project:

```jsx
import { ChartContext } from 'react-graphene';
import Background from 'react-graphene/components/background';
import { PlotLine } from 'react-graphene/components/plotLine';

const MyChart = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <ChartContext>
      <Background gridLineColor="#555555" gridLineWidth={1} />
      <PlotLine data={data} />
    </ChartContext>
  );
};
```

## Customization

React-Graphene offers various customization options for your charts:

### Grid Customization

Control the appearance of the grid with the following props:

```jsx
<Background 
  gridLineColor="#3498db" // Custom grid color
  gridLineWidth={2}       // Custom grid line thickness
/>
```

### Coming Soon

- OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) data visualization
- Step and linear interpolation options
- Additional plot types
- Annotation capabilities
- Export options

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from [PyQtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/), a powerful scientific graphics and GUI library for Python. React-Graphene aims to bring similar capabilities to the React ecosystem.
